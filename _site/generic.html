<p> I am Dr. Manjunath Omana Kuttan, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies. My academic interests primarily focus on the development of novel tools and techniques for fundamental physics analyses. My research is centered on creating cutting-edge Deep Learning techniques and statistical methods for high-energy physics, computational modeling of fundamental interactions, and tackling inverse problems through simulation-based physics inference. Solving these inverse problems involve modeling the relevant physics including detector simulations and utilizing AI methods to infer the underlying physics from experimental data. </p> 
<br>



<p> My academic journey began with the <strong> India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) </strong> project, where I was actively involved in R&D for the mini-ICAL detector, a prototype for the proposed Iron CALorimeter (ICAL) detector. During my Masterâ€™s studies, I gained hands-on experience in various aspects of experimental physics, including fabricating and testing of Resistive Plate Chambers for the experiment and in the installation of the mini-ICAL detector. </p> 
<br>
<p> My Master's thesis marked the beginning of my journey with Machine Learning techniques. I developed AI methods to reconstruct momentum of neutrinos from the data in the INO-ICAL detector and to identify the charge and directionality of cosmic muons in the mini-ICAL detector.</p>
<br>
 <p><p>
    Eager to further explore AI's vast potential in fundamental physics, I transitioned from my experimental <strong>Neutrino Physics</strong> background to pursuing a Ph.D. in <strong>High Energy Nuclear Physics</strong> at the intersection of theory and experiment. My research focused on developing AI methods to bridge the gap between theoretical models and experimental data in high energy heavy-ion collisions. This experience gave me  a strong foundation in modelling the dynamics of high-energy collisions, state-of-the-art techniques for data analysis, GEANT based detector simulations, and AI-driven physics analyses. I worked extensively with theoretical models such as UrQMD, CMF, and relativistic hydrodynamics, and developed AI methods to analyse data from experiments such as <strong>HADES@GSI, CBM@FAIR, PANDA@FAIR, STAR@RHIC, and NA61@CERN.</strong> </p> 
 <br>
 <p> Currently, as a member of the <a href="https://kiss.pages.desy.de/website" target="KISS website">KISS collaboration</a>,  my research focuses on the development of ultra-fast simulation techniques for heavy-ion collisions using modern deep generative methods. This involves developing diffusion models and autoregressive generative models for fast simulations of heavy-ion collision events, speeding up relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, and accelerating detector simulations. These AI-driven techniques have broad applications across nuclear and particle physics, offering significant advancements in both speed and accuracy for future experiments. </p> 
 <br>
 <p> My diverse background in experimental Neutrino Physics, High Energy Physics, and AI places me at the unique <strong>intersection of theory, experiment, and data science</strong>. With AI being the Swiss knife in my toolbox, I aim to continue advancing my research career by tackling complex challenges and pushing the boundaries of our understanding of fundamental physics.</p>
